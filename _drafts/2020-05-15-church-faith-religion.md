Church, Faith, and Religion

I used to think they were the same

But they are connected parts of triangle

Josh,

I hope you’re having a lovely time with your family in Ohio.

I’m so thankful for the relationship we have, and how we can discuss the deepest questions of our lives. 

When we all had dinner a couple Fridays ago on the back patio, we talked about faith and you mentioned how you wondered: what is the source of our existence?

This fundamental question is something I’ve been struggling with for the past year. When I first faced it, it was the cause of crippling anxiety. I was in physical pain. I couldn’t sleep well. I couldn’t avoid thinking about it enough to get anything done at work.

For a long time, it snuck up on me in the quiet moments: at the movies with Caitlin, or most often, in a moment of peace on a Sunday afternoon. 

I’ve confronted this question over and over this past year, to the point where I at least don’t get very anxious any more. What I’m working through now is trying to figure out what my response to the question should be. 

One part of this journey has been to re-establish what I believe in. 

My relationship with faith hasn’t been in good shape for a long time. I grew up in a baptist church and went to a small private Christian school through sixth grade. What I remember is more or less went through the motions. Taking communion and saying the words other people were saying because I didn’t feel like I could say that I didn’t know how I felt about it all. 

I don’t know if I was more or less bought in than the other kids, but I do remember feeling more distant as I went through high school. As I learned more about science and grew to have a very critical, analytical approach to life, I sought meaning in the logical nature of the scientific method. 

And honestly, that’s been the way I’ve approached life more or less for the last 15 years. As something to be analyzed, reasoned about, and solved.

Until I was faced with such a question I couldn’t solve that way: 

What happens when we die? 

As I re-evaluate my faith, I am perceiving it in new ways. 

First, I am reckoning with the fundamental flaw in my belief that science can provide a source of absolute meaning and truth. Quite simply, there are some questions we can’t reason our way to answering, most especially questions about our existence. The are some great mysteries that have yet to, and may never be “solved.”

Second, I am coming to terms with how I have long equated faith, religion, and church with each other, when they are three very different things. This false equivalency has led me to think thoughts like: “Christianity is a farce, just look how Christians act!” Or “I don’t feel comfortable with how my Church treats women, therefore I can’t believe in God.”

Faith is the trust or belief in something that cannot be fully seen or understood.

Religion is the organized system of beliefs and rituals.

Church is a gathering of a group of people, not a building. 

Separating faith, religion, and church into distinct concepts has helped me realize that going to church isn’t having faith, and being religious doesn’t make you Christian. Said another way, not going to church doesn’t make you any less (or more!) of a Christian.

Third, I’ve realize how much I’ve discredited the idea of faith, church, and religion because I’ve never felt like I’ve been allowed to show any doubts about them or to question them.
