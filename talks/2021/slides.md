![](img/bg.png)

^ Hi

^ Thanks for having me

^ Thanks to Rylan, Dan, and Marty for organizing

^ Third January in a row at Boulder Ruby

^ Going to build on previous talks

---

# 2019

^ 2019

^ Shared a crazy idea

^ For using Ruby objects to render views

^ Inspired by ideas from React

---

# 2020

^ 2020

^ That idea had become my full time job at GitHub

^ Talked about how Rails views work under the hood

^ All execute in the same context, meaning they can share state

---

# 2021

^ Today I'm going to share what we've learned scaling to hundreds of components in our application

^ Open sourcing some of those components

^ and building a thriving community around the project
