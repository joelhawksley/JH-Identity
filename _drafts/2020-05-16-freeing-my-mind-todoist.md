# On reminders

Recurring reminders (via tools such as Todoist or Apple Reminders) are the single most important technology in my life. No other tool is more effective at aligning my day-to-day life with my foundational priorities. Here’s why, and how.

## Priorities

My priorities are a direct product of my struggle with debilitating anxiety. My therapist had me imagine myself in old age, reflecting on how I lived my life. What would I be proud of? What would I regret?

Based on my responses, we came up with a list of priorities:

1) Finding meaning and purpose through spiritual growth.
2) A loving, supportive marriage.
3) Deep connection with family & friends.
4) A more peaceful and just community, country, and world.
5) Making meaningful contributions to my fields of expertise. 

Then, we talked about what my life looked like. Was it a reflection of these priorities? 


## Being present

By using recurring reminders, I’m able to focus more deeply in the present moment, knowing that my worries are neatly filed away, ready for my attention when I want to think about them.

## What makes for a good reminder
