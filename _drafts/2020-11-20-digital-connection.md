title: Human connection in the age of video calls

> _Find a quiet room, wear headphones, and remove distractions._

It’s hard to feel connected to other people when you live your life on video calls. 

I should know: I’ve worked remotely for several years, sometimes going months without seeing a colleague in person.

Now with COVID, our social lives are remote too: happy hours, dinners with friends, meetups, therapy, and even weddings are happening online.

Most of the time, video calls are awful. But they don’t have to be!

While they will never beat being with others in person, they can be enjoyable.

Here’s how I stay sane and connected with the people I care about in the age of video calls.

## Audio is everything

I remember learning this lesson early in life, at a Bose store of all places. 

There was a small theatre. A video played, repeating the same scene of an action movie over and over again. 

Each time the scene repeated, either the audio or the video was degraded. 

When the audio was garbled, fuzzy, and lacking detail in high and low frequencies, it didn’t matter how sharp and clear the video was. There was no immersion in the scene, no connection with the characters.

Then, the opposite: the video was fuzzy and distorted, but the audio was clear. All of a sudden, the experience was engaging, despite the video quality being subpar.

This same lesson, reinforced in my years of mixing sound for live events and a degree in visual communication, 

## What matters

AirPods are great, but I used old corded iPhone headphones

Echo cancellation

### High fidelity

### Low latency

You have a problem. It’s hard to feel connected to other people when you live your life on video calls.
- Rank from most to least important (Michael pollan’s food rules)
- They do know about being in a quiet room
- They don’t know about latency
- They don’t know about FaceTime audio
- They don’t know about high fidelity zoom modes
- They don’t know about echo cancellation
- Environmental distractions - noise, visual, phone, airplane mode

Group size

My perspective is different because I’ve been working remotely for a long time.
My perspective is different because I have a background in visual communication / photography and did live sound work for a long time.
