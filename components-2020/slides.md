^ When I joined GitHub, I remember something @eileencodes said early on: If it doesn't have to do with our business, it needs to go in Rails.

^ In other words, our mindset was to be "upstream by default"

---

^ Why do we do this?

^ We didn't always work with stock Rails.

^ In fact, up until 2018, we were on long running forks of both Rails and Ruby.

---

^ The maintenance burden of this arrangement grew over time to be unsustainable.

---

^ It's clear that a lot of us are dealing with this.

---

^ Gems like Draper and Cells have _millions_ of downloads.

---

^ Every Rails app I've worked in has done something similar

^ Whether using these gems or rolling something custom.
