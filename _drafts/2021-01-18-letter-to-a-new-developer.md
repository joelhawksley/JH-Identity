Dear new developer,

## Interviewing for work-life balance

How do you know whether you'll be expected to work 60-hour weeks, have Slack on your phone, or be on call 24/7?

One trick I've found works well is to ask your interviewer to tell you about their last vacation.

Another way to assess the work-life balance at a company is to reply to an email on a weekend and see if you get a response!
