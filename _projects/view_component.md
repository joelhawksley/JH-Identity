I created [ViewComponent](https://github.com/github/view_component), a framework for building encapsulated, unit-testable view components in Ruby on Rails.

I also [added](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/36388) support for component frameworks like ViewComponent to Rails.

I've spoken about the project [at](https://youtu.be/y5Z5a6QdA-M) [RailsConf](https://youtu.be/YVYRus_2KZM), [RubyConf Taiwan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGAs0QALAiM), and on the [Ruby on Rails](https://5by5.tv/rubyonrails/276), [Ruby Blend](https://www.therubyblend.com/9), and [Ruby Rogues](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/rr-461-rethinking-the-view-layer-with-components-with-joel-hawksley/) podcasts.
