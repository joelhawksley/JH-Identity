# Four arguments for the elimination of television

By Jerry Mander

1978

## Summary

Jerry Mander argues that television is bad for the world. It separates us from first hand experience, limits the breadth of perspectives, causes negative physical effects, and biases towards a subset of experiences.

## Why I read it

I grew up without a television at home. Even at the time, I knew this was out of the ordinary. As my friends obsessed over MTV, video games, and movies, I spent time on the computer. 

Why did my parents raise me this way? This book is part of the reason.

## Takeaways

### Watching TV is not an experience

One argument for television is that it allows us to experience more than we could without it. A child in Nebraska can watch a performance of an orchestra in New York City. Yet watching the performance is a shadow of the experience of seeing it in person. 

### Technology upsets the natural balance

Technology is prone to upset the natural balance because its evolution is not constrained by physics. 

### Advertising as deadweight

> Advertising, then, serves to further the movement of humans into artificial environments by narrowing the conception of diversity to fit the framework of commodities while unifying people within this conception. The result is a singularly channeled mentality, nicely open to receiving commercial messages, ready to confuse human need with the advertiser’s need to sell commodities. [...] Advertising exists only to purvey what people don’t need.
