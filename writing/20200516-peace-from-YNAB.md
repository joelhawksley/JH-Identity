# Why You Need A Budget

Intro
	Married, moved, one income, newly combined finances
	Money as primary stressor
	Envelope budgeting growing up - clothes budget
	Going to share lessons from five years of using YNAB
	Results - goals accomplished (continents), financial peace, 
	
Air gapped
	Every dollar tracked, no matter what
	Budget should express all potential liabilities
	Insurance deductibles funded
	
Roll with the punches
	Fail forward when budget doesn’t anticipate new need, but learn from it!
	CSA -> needed $330, paid from emergency fund and adjusted grocery budget
	
Budget for lifetime cost
	- Don’t just save for a car down payment, save for car payments and eventual replacement of vehicle. Currently have one vehicle paid off, but paying same amount to save for down payment of replacement. Dave Ramsey strategy for car cost
	- Budget for replacement of major items, accounting for current lifetime. Hot water heater - 10 year cycle, $1800, 8 years old, saving x/month plus X set aside

Isolate known, consistent expenses
	- If an expense is consistent and recurring, give it its own budget! Or at least group them together. (Phone/Spotify)
	- Car maintenance/registration/insurance
	- For captain, we have both a general fund and a specific item for his pet insurance premium.
	- Splitting out known expenses into their own category prevents us from spending money allocated for an expense

Plan for the unplanned
	- Unplanned category
	- Monthly contributions to emergency fund
	- Because we have an air gapped budget, we know how much $ we need to survive in case of job loss

Have an allowance
	- Judgement-free money. Golfing, clothes, dinner with friends
	- Our money vs. mine or hers

Conclusion
	Predictability, remove stress from our lives. We know what we can afford.
